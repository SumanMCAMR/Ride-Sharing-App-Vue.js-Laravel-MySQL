# Ride Sharing App Vue.js, Laravel, MySQL

**Ride-sharing App**

This ride-sharing app is built using Vue.js, Laravel, and MySQL. It uses a variety of other frameworks and libraries, including:
* Vue.js
* Pinia Store (Vue 3)
* Laravel
* Pusher and Echo for broadcast
* Twilio for OTP verification
* Maska for input mask

The app allows users to request rides, track their drivers, and pay for their rides using their mobile phones. It also includes features for drivers, such as the ability to accept and reject ride requests, navigate to pickup and drop-off locations, and track their earnings.

To use the app, users simply create an account using mobile number and enter their pickup and drop-off locations. The app will then match them with a driver who is nearby. Once the driver accepts the request, the user can track their progress on the map and see their estimated arrival time.

When the ride is complete, the user can pay the driver using their mobile phone(Needed). The app also allows users to rate their drivers and provide feedback.

This ride-sharing app is a fully functional and scalable solution for providing ride-hailing services. It is easy to use and provides a variety of features for both riders and drivers.
